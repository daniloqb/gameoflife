This is the default version of the game Jhon Conway's Game of life.

This code is under development and will be the base for more complex cellular automata.

For this reason is that I used python objects to describe the cellulas.

The basic code could be more simples, but I want to add other features and this moment I am thinking that objects
is the best solution. I think, and I will see.
